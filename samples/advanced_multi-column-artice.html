		<p>of our lo&shy;cal pa&shy;pers had been picked up by the AP and had spread world&shy;wide. We did in&shy;ter&shy;views for news&shy;pa&shy;pers and ra&shy;dio sta&shy;tions all across the coun&shy;try and at least one ra&shy;dio sta&shy;tion in Can&shy;a&shy;da.</p>
		<p>With all the ex&shy;po&shy;sure it wasn’t long be&shy;fore we were made aware that the re&shy;cord of 120 hours had been bro&shy;ken al&shy;ready. A few emails and phone calls lat&shy;er and we found out that two State Farm agents from Tex&shy;as held the last re&shy;cord cer&shy;ti&shy;fied by Guin&shy;ness of 118 hours. That was quite a down&shy;er. We had fol&shy;low&shy;ers count&shy;ing on us to break the re&shy;cord and we had fig&shy;ured eve&shy;ry&shy;thing on a faulty prem&shy;ise.</p>
		<p>We re&shy;solved to just keep at it and hope for the best. We re&shy;ceived lots of en&shy;cour&shy;age&shy;ment from friends, fam&shy;i&shy;ly and fans and we couldn’t let them down. Af&shy;ter many miles and a few ad&shy;ven&shy;tures (which can be found here) we fin&shy;ished our cra&shy;zy trip at four cor&shy;ners. We beat our ex&shy;pec&shy;ta&shy;tions by a long shot, hit&shy;ting all 48 con&shy;tig&shy;u&shy;ous states in 106 hours and 43 min&shy;utes. Even though we had five more hours of driv&shy;ing to get home, we were ec&shy;stat&shy;ic.</p>
		<p>Af&shy;ter we wrapped up we found out how many peo&shy;ple had heard about our Great Amer&shy;i&shy;can Road Trip. We had as many as 25,000 hits on this site in a day from doz&shy;ens of coun&shy;tries from eve&shy;ry con&shy;ti&shy;nent ex&shy;cept Ant&shy;arc&shy;ti&shy;ca. We were men&shy;tioned in mag&shy;a&shy;zines rang&shy;ing from a Chris&shy;tian Mag&shy;a&shy;zine to Car and Driv&shy;er. We con&shy;tin&shy;ued to do in&shy;ter&shy;views and we found news ar&shy;ti&shy;cles in Chi&shy;nese, Ger&shy;man, and many oth&shy;er lan&shy;guag&shy;es. We were as&shy;tound&shy;ed.</p>
		<p>So many peo&shy;ple con&shy;nect&shy;ed with our trip in so many ways and we have been an in&shy;spi&shy;ra&shy;tion to many to hit the road or fol&shy;low their dreams. Some of those we in&shy;spired were in&shy;spired to beat our re&shy;cord and ac&shy;com&shy;plished just that. The trip was great, the sense of ac&shy;com&shy;plish&shy;ment was won&shy;der&shy;ful but know&shy;ing we might have made a dif&shy;fer&shy;ence in some&shy;one’s day, let alone life, is bet&shy;ter than any re&shy;cord.</p>
		<blockquote class="not-regioned" region="quote-thread">&#147;To anyone we inspired, thanks.&#148;</blockquote>
		<p>To an&shy;y&shy;one we in&shy;spired, to all those that en&shy;joyed our jour&shy;ney, to our fam&shy;i&shy;lies and to our friends, thank you.</p>
